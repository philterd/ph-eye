# ph-eye

PH-Eye is a service for hosting AI/NLP models for the purposes of finding PII and PHI in text. PH-Eye can be used standalone but it was designed and created for use with [Phileas](https://github.com/philterd/phileas) and [Philter](https://github.com/philterd/philter) and as such provides tight integration with each.
